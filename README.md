# My Personal Project: Wildlife Rescue

## An Animal Donation Application
This application is essentially an application where users can 
donate money to endangered animals of their choice, and they can donate to as many 
animals as they want to. 

The application will allow users to view the previous donations they made, their receipts,
their favourite animals, as well as see the current amount donated to a specific animal, and the goal.

**Features** of this application include allowing users to _view previous donations_ they made, 
their _donation receipts_, their _favourite animals_, animals _categorised_ 
as *critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable*.

From personal experience, my family fostered various shelter dogs back in Indonesia, 
where dog shelters are underfunded. The majority of dog shelters in Indonesia are 
run-down and filthy. Furthermore, many individuals prefer to buy puppies from breeders 
when there are so many dogs in shelters who need care. We had no room in our home for 
another dog because we already had two, so we "fostered" a puppy in a shelter by donating money to 
the shelter for the pup's food and healthcare. I was wondering whether we might apply this approach to other species, 
particularly endangered species. As a result, I'd like to create an application that will enable people 
like myself to assist other creatures in need that aren't physically within our reach.
